<img align="right" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/812010489248088088/875648580252233738/Comp_Cube.png" height="220" width="220">

*Ever wanted to cube, but didnt have a cube at hand? <br> Or perhaps you wanted to learn, or just wanted a simple solution to your scrambled cube? <br> Maybe you want to visualize how it would look?*
<br> *or maybe you are a 'Fewest Moves' enthusiast and want to check your solution!* <br>

Fret no more, for 
<br> --> Cubord just landed. 

> *Cub-ord, Disc-ord -> get it?* 

*Cubord* is the implementation of the [cubot.io](https://github.com/AkshathRaghav/cubot.io) library for discord. In other words, cubord is a cubing discord bot. <br>  

Basically, all of the methods in cubot.io have been used in Cubord's code. But Cubord offers more than just some library outputs. It stores your cube, lets you time yourself, keeps track of your times and your best time, shows you your cube and more. 

To get started with Cubord in your discord server, click here - it'll take you to official documentation.
