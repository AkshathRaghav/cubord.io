### Cubord is the implementation of the (cubot.io)[] library for discord. In other words, cubord is a cubing discord bot. <br> 
> *Cub-ord, Disc-ord -> get it?* <br> 

##### Basically, all of the methods in cubot.io have been used in Cubord's code. But Cubord offers more than just some library outputs. It stores your cube, lets you time yourself, keeps track of your times and your best time, shows you your cube ( scroll down ) and more.
